# Digital Blueprint for Smart Learning (DBSL)

## Overview

The **Digital Blueprint for Smart Learning (DBSL)** is an online platform designed to automate the preparation of essential classroom documents for teachers under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). By generating professional, CBC-aligned PDFs (Lesson Concept Breakdowns, Schemes of Work, Lesson Plans, Lesson Notes, and Exercises), DBSL saves teachers significant preparation time, allowing them to focus on direct teaching and student engagement.
